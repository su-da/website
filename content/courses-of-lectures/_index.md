This is a collection of my selected lectures for college students.

## Open source licensing and intellectual property

Used only for discussion on classes. Most slides are just repacked from

(Especially the "Intellectual Property/Open Source Licensing" section)
with some additional materials, which are copyrighted by their original
owners.
